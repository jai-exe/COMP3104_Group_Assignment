George Brown College opened its doors in 1968, welcoming just over 2,000 students. 
In addition to programs in construction, early childhood education, dental services and the culinary arts — subjects we continue to teach — we once offered programs that might not be quite as relevant today, like signwriting and watchmaking.
Believe it or not, we even prepared students for careers at sea through a marine engineering program.
