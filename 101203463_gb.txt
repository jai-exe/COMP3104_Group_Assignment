George Brown College opened its doors in 1968, welcoming just over 2,000 students. 
In addition to programs in construction, early childhood education, dental services and the culinary arts — subjects we continue to teach — we once offered programs that might not be quite as relevant today, like signwriting and watchmaking.
Believe it or not, we even prepared students for careers at sea through a marine engineering program.
Located in the heart of downtown Toronto, the college is surrounded by potential employers, and many of them work closely with the college in providing skills necessary for future employment.
Toronto is the largest city in Canada and a cultural melting pot with people of many nationalities residing there.
